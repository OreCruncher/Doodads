The Ring of Flight gives the player creative flight capability when equipped in a Baubles ring
slot.  There are 5 types of rings:

- Flight Core.  Does not give flight ability itself but is used to create the other rings.  There is no crafting recipe for the core - it has to be discovered in a village blacksmith or dungeon chest.
- Avian Leg Ring Band.  Basic flight ring crafted with a Flight Core and Feather Wings.  Has the least durability of the rings.
- Ring of Methodical Flight.  This ring has much more durability than the Avian Leg Ring, but is much slower as well.  It is crafted using the Flight Core and Obidian Wings.
- Stout Ring of Flight.  This ring has a little less durability than Methodical Ring, but the flight speed is the same as the Avian Leg Ring.  It is crafted using the Flight Core and Sturdy Wings.
- Ring of the Zephyr.  This ring has less durability than the Methodical Ring, but faster flight speed than the other rings.  It is crafted using the Flight Core and Speedy Wings.

The Feather and Obsidian Wings can be crafted by the player.  The Stout and Speedy Wings cannot be
crafted, and have to be found in village blacksmith and dungeon chests.

Each of the rings has a durability that will be consumed when the player flies.  When the
durability reaches 0, the ring will revert back to a Flight Core.  The player will drop to the
ground and will take damage if the fall distance is high enough.

..	note::
	The flight rings cannot be repaired using Repair Paste.  So there.
